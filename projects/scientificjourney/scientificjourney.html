<h3>A Scientific Journey</h3>
<h6>Student → Engineer → Teacher → Student</h6>

<p>My path to graduate school may be unusual, but I have been engaging in the scientific process throughout my studies and professional life.</p>

    <h5>High School: Alcohol Stoves</h5>

    <p>At Deerfield Academy, I used stats class as an opportunity to craft simple alcohol stoves out of pop cans and to compare their performance scientifically.</p>
    <p><em>What is the optimal burner hole size for maximum fuel efficency? What's the optimal height of the stove to achieve needed burn time and minimum priming time?</em></p>
    <p>My alcohol stove project was a nutshell of the scientific process - starting with question formulation, continuing with experimental design and data collection, and ending with interpretation and communication of the results.</p>

    <h5>College: Project-Based Research</h5>
    <p>As my coding abilities developed throughout college, I was eager to apply them to project-based and educational research. This took many forms throughout my time at the school.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In a software projects class, my partner and I examined how budding engineers could better prepare for technical interviews. We surveyed departing seniors and developed a website called <a class="has-text-info" href="http://puzzledom.herokuapp.com/">Puzzledom</a> which was designed to offer self-guided interview practice through logic puzzles and coding challenges.</li>
        <li>Working for the <a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/kraemerlab/" class="has-text-info">Kraemer Lab</a>, I implemented a mass-distributable online experiment designed to test how differences in physics intuition (as measured by time-bound responses to Free Body Diagram) correlated with SES, level of education, field of work, and other factors.</li>
        <li>For my senior honors thesis, I worked on a platform for teaching intermediate-level computer science. Read more on <a href="?path=projects%2Fscientificjourney%2Fseniorthesis%2Fseniorthesis.html#bottom-sheet" class="has-text-info">this portfolio page</a></li>
