<h3>Scientific Work</h3>
<!-- <h6>Student → Engineer → Teacher → Student</h6>

<p>My path to graduate school may be unusual, but I have been engaging in the scientific process throughout my studies and professional life.</p>

    <h5>Professional: Data Driven Engineer</h5>
    <p>Entering the software industry, I developed an affinity for the using data to improve our understanding of and answer questions about our products.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><img src="projects/scientificjourney/powerbi.png" class="is-pulled-left inline-thumbnail" alt="PowerBI Logo"><p>I was in charge of telemetry on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/intune-company-portal/id719171358">Intune Company Portal</a> team at Microsoft. Led an end-to-end initiative for improving our app by incorporating and learning from telemetry, which ultimately led to a 70% reduction in login error rates, improved live-site serviceability, and more-informed feature development (through AB testing). Also made contributions with respect to an app-wide rewrite from Objective-C to Swift, extending our iOS app to support macOS, several new user-flows, threat-modeling and security hardening, bug & crash fixes, and quality improvements.</p>
        <p>To do this, I built a data pipelipe using ApplicationInsights to send data points to an in house Microsoft cloud service (the precursor to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/data-lake/">Azure Data Lake</a>) for processing. I wrote analysis scripts using a precursor of <a href="http://usql.io/">U-SQL</a> and authored dashboards and set up alerts in <a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/">PowerBI</a>.</p></li>
        <li><img src="projects/scientificjourney/grove-garden-app.png" class="is-pulled-left inline-thumbnail" alt="Grove Garden App">Participated in UX testing as part of the Grove development team. We invited members of the public to try out specific new features we were developing in order to test the intuitivness and efficency of our use experience. Some flows that we tested include insertion of a seed pod into our smart gardening appliance, scanning a QR code on the seed pod packaging to register it with our app and enable automatic growth management, and reading of plant care tutorials.</li>

    <h5>College: Project-Based Research</h5>
    <p>As my coding abilities developed throughout college, I was eager to apply them to project-based and educational research. This took many forms throughout my time at the school.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><div><img src="projects/scientificjourney/puzzledom.png" class="is-pulled-left inline-thumbnail" alt="Puzzledom Logo">In a software projects class, my partner and I examined how budding engineers could better prepare for technical interviews. We surveyed departing seniors and developed a website called <a class="has-text-info" href="http://puzzledom.herokuapp.com/">Puzzledom</a> which was designed to offer self-guided interview practice through logic puzzles and coding challenges.</div></li>
        <li><div><img src="projects/scientificjourney/kraemerlab.png" class="is-pulled-left inline-thumbnail" alt="KraemerLab Logo">Working for the <a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/kraemerlab/" class="has-text-info">Kraemer Lab</a>, I implemented a mass-distributable online experiment designed to test how differences in physics intuition (as measured by time-bound responses to Free Body Diagram) correlated with SES, level of education, field of work, and other factors.</div></li>
        <li><img src="projects/scientificjourney/seniorthesis/sketchworld-logo.png" class="is-pulled-left inline-thumbnail" alt="SketchWorld Logo">For my senior honors thesis, I worked on a platform for teaching beginner text-based coding & computer science.

        <p class="is-size-7">Alchol Stove Image: By Frank Behnsen, CC BY-SA 3.0</p>
    </div>
    <p>At Deerfield Academy, I used statistics class as an opportunity to craft simple alcohol stoves out of pop cans and to compare their performance scientifically.</p>
    <p><em>What is the optimal burner hole size for maximum fuel efficency? What's the optimal height of the stove to achieve needed burn time and minimum priming time?</em></p>
    <p>My alcohol stove project was a nutshell of the scientific process - starting with question formulation, continuing with experimental design and data collection, and ending with interpretation and communication of the results.</p>
