    <p>Running CoderDojo afterschool programs around Dartmouth, I noticed that kids seemed to get bored of <a class="has-text-info" href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> after a while. Many of them expressed a desire to move on and start learning "real" coding.</p>

<h5>Vision</h5>
<p>Design & implement a coding learning environment with the following key features:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Online, mobile-friendly interface</strong>, so that students can access the site from anywhere, on any device.</li>
    <li><strong>Easy "click-and-run" interface</strong>, so that creators don't get trapped in the wild west of setting up a coding environment.</li>
    <li><strong>An accessible but powerful graphics library</strong>, allowing beginners' first creations to be far more engaging that a command-line hello world.</li>
    <li><strong>Viral sharing potential</strong> through features that allow kid's sketches (mini-programs) to be shared like links, installed like apps, and run like games.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Execution</h5>
