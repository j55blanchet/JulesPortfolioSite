<h5>Background</h5>
<p>Grove was based on an idea: <em>if people grow some of the food they eat, they'll live healthier and move fulfilling lives.</em></p>
<p>The company's goal was to get people growing their own food, and the company's strategy was threefold:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Build beautiful, easy-to-use kitchen gardening appliances to automate the tedious parts of the gardening experience.</li>
    <li>Deliver ready-to-grow "seedpods" that could be inserted into the appliacne like a Kureig cup.</li>
    <li>Tie these together with a software experience that combines a mobile app with a backend API service capable of controlling the appliances remotely and learning over time how to best grow each pod.</li>
</ol>

<h5>The App</h5>
<p>The app was designed to deliver on three core promises:
    <ol>
        <li>Allow the user to set up & control their appliance hardware.</li>
        <li>Give users guidance on planting, maintaining, harvesting, and eating their garden.</li>
        <li>Offer users a porthole to manage their "Grove Experience" by customizing their subscription of seedpods.</li>
    </ol>
